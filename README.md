# Snoonu Merchant Intelligence Platform (MerchantOS)

Hackathon prototype for **Snoonu Hackathon 2026 – Case 3: Merchant & Collaborator Experience**.

MerchantOS upgrades the Snoonu merchant portal from “stats + notifications” into an **intelligent growth workspace** that helps merchants:
- understand what is hurting performance,
- get prioritized actions to fix it,
- simulate improvements before committing,
- and adopt campaigns/discounting with profit awareness.
